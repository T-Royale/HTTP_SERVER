# HTTP_SERVER
Code for the "Write your own HTTP Server" course at Low Level Academy https://lowlevel.academy/courses/http
I made this repo so the course platform can test my code as I make progress in the course.
If you are taking this course, I don't recomend copying my solution without understanding what's going on.
